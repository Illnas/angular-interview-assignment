# Project: Photo Viewer Assignment 

This project is selection process assignment.




## Tasks

- To be made with React, Angular(TypeScript is must!) or just with SCSS
  
- BEM methodology must be used
- Usage of UI frameworks (Bootstrap, Material etc) is not permitted
- Need to create and use components as efficient as possible
- SCSS for every component needs to follow design, and for project as whole
- Less SCSS, more reusability of code
- Needs to write code in English
- Mobile Design and Responsive Design






## Requirements Satisfied

- Task was finished in Angular with usage of SCSS
- BEM methodoloy was implemented, not sure if I used it correctly
- Did not use any UI framework
- I did use components efficiently
- Used mixin for text, since most text had different font sizes, line heights etc 
- Code is in English (except content which was in Croatian Language)
- Mobile and Responsive designs were implemented
